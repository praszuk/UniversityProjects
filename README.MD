**This repo contains a programs for different subjects from PJATK.**

_Each project has only a few commits. I try to upload only final version on github. I keep the rest on my private git server._

3rd semester:
 - SKJ (Computer networks and network programming in Java):
	 - [Agent-TCP](Agent-TCP) "Network of Counters" - program, which uses TCP protocol to synchronize counters between clients. More info in [Task.pdf](Agent-TCP/Task.pdf).
 
 - TAK (Computer techniques and architecture):
 	 - [EmulatorOfStateLanguageTuring](EmulatorOfStateLanguageTuring) - program, which emulates [Turing's machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) and allows for input own code and execute it. More info [Task(PL).pdf](EmulatorOfStateLanguageTuring/Task(PL).pdf)
 	 - [Parser: Python -> TCL](ParserPython_AssemblerTCL) - program, which parse simple python operations like addition, substraction etc. to TCL language, which is like an Assembler, created for this subject. More info [Task(PL).jpg](ParserPython_AssemblerTCL/Task(PL).jpg).

4th semester:
 - NAI (Artificial Intelligence tools):
 	 - [Perceptron](Perceptron) - program, which generates random points in a specific range, computes NET and "y" and shows on plots data using 2 activation neural function. More info [Task(PL).jpg](Perceptron/Task(PL).jpg)
 	 - [SuperVisedLearning](SuperVised_Learning) - program, which is implementation for Super Vised Learning for 1 layer network. More info [Task(PL).jpg](SuperVised_Learning/Task(PL).jpg).
 
 - TPO (Distributed programming technologies)
 	 - [Dictionary](Dictionary) - 3 subprograms Client, MiddleServer, LanguageServer to create a service of translating. Servers are launching manually. Programs send data over TCP. More info [Task(PL).jpg](Dictionary/Task(PL).jpg).
